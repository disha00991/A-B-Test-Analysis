# A/B Test Analysis
This was a typical experiment analysis held at a company, where the team has just introduced a new UI design to the app. The goal of the new design is to increase user engagement (measured by minutes spent on site). The team ran an A/B test to evaluate the change. Using the data, I am required to help the team understand the impact of the UI change better.

# What I did:
I have performed a thorough analysis of the results generated by an A/B test, to recommend if a newly designed feature on a Forum Website should be pushed to production or not depending on whether it is increasing any user engagement.

# Dataset
Tables provided are as follows:
 1. t1_user_active_min.csv : Active minutes spent by each user after the experiment began
 2. t2_user_variant.csv : Mapping of each user participating in experiment to 0 or 1. 0 means that user was in control group and saw old design, 1 means treatment group and saw new design.
 3. t3_user_active_min_pre.csv : Active minutes spent by each user before the experiment began
 4. t4_user_attributes.csv : Attributes of the users, like gender or user type (Non reader/Contributor etc.)

# Results
Some of the Visualizations that came out:
